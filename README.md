## Meteo Monitor Analyzer ## 

This is a simple Selenium Web Driver based application for getting weather station data gathered by IMGW institute (http://www.pogodynka.pl). Data is saved to CSV format. There is no API to download results so reading of webpage must be used. The page is dynamic, some elements must be activated and because of it simple downloading of HTML document couldn't be used.
